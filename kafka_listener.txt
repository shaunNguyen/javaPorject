Kafka Listenses- Explained :
----------------------------
You need to set advertised.listeners (or KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS if you're using Docker images) to the external address (host/IP) so that clients can correctly can correctly connect to it. Otherwise they'll try to connect to the internal host address-and if that's not reachavle then problems ensue.
	.LISTENERS are what interfaces Kafka binds to
	.ADVERTISED_LISTENERS are how clients can connect

Is anyone listening?
When a client(producer/consumer) starts, it will request metadata about which broker is the leader for a partition. 
The metadata returned will include the endpoints available for the leader broker for that partition, and the client will then use those endpoints to connect to the broker to read/wrtie data as required

Let's assume you have more than one network. This could be things like:
	1. docker internal network(s) plus host machine
	2. brokers in the cloud, and on-permises machines locally
You need to tell Kafka how the brokers can reach each other, but also make sure that external clients(producers/consumers) can reach the broker they need to.
The key thing is that when you run a client, the broker you pass to it is just where it's going to go and get the metadata about brokers in the cluster from. 
The actual host and IP that it will connect to for reading/writing data is based on the data that the broker passes back in the initial connection- even if it's just a single node and the broker returned is the same as the one connected to. 

For configuring this correctly, you ned to understand that Kafka brokers can have multiple listeners. A listeners is a combination of:
	1. Host/IP
	2. Port 
	3. Protocol
Let's check out some config. Often the protocol is used for the listener name too, but here let's make it nice and clear by using abstract names for the listeners:
	KAFKA_LISTENERS: LISTENER_BOB://kafka0:29092,LISTENER_FRED://localhost:9092
	KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS: LISTENER_BOB://kafka0:29092,LISTENER_FRED://localhost:9092
	KAFKA_LISTENER_SECURITY_PROTOCOL_MAP: LISTENER_BOB:PLAINTEXT,LISTENER_FRED:PLAINTEXT
	KAFKA_INTER_BROKER_LISTENER_NAME: LISTENER_BOB
KAFKA_LISTENERS: is a comma-separated list of listeners, and the host/ip and port to which kafka binds to on which to listen, default is 0.0.0.0
KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS: This is the metadata that's passwd back to clients
KAFKA_INTER_BROKER_LISTENER_NAME: define key-value pairs for the security protocol to use per listener name

Why can I connect to the broker, but the client still fails?
